# MovieBase
## A web application built by Edward Montooth used to  maintain a database of movies, their producers, and some of their actors!
#### The application uses a database design of two tables, Movies and Producers. In the Movies table the columns consist of the movie ID which is the primary key, name, year, actors, and producer ID. In the Producers table the primary key is the producer ID followed by columns of name, about, and movies. The two tables feature a *one to many relationship* where one producer can have many movies in the database. Producers must be added before their movie is added to the database and if a producer is deleted the movies belonging to that producer will also be deleted. 
#### Below is the database design in table format. 

### **Movies**
Movie ID | Name | Year | Actors | Producer ID
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
Content from cell 1 | Content from cell 2
Content in the first column | Content in the second column

### **Producers**
Producer ID | Name | About | Movies 
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- 
Content from cell 1 | Content from cell 2
Content in the first column | Content in the second column
