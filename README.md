# MovieBase
## A web application built by Edward Montooth used to  maintain a database of movies, their producers, and some of their actors!
#### The application uses a database design of two tables, Movies and Producers. In the Movies table the columns consist of the movie ID which is the primary key, name, year, actors, and producer ID. In the Producers table the primary key is the producer ID followed by columns of name, about, and movies.
